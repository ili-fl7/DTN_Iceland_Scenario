A set of modified and developed classes for Iceland southern road mobility model.

****************************************************

Description:

This repository is corresponded to a master's final project. 
It aims at analyzing the feasibility of utilizing Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTN) in Iceland context.
Simulations are performed using The ONE simulator, an open-source software written in Java.
This repository, includes all the modified or developed classes for the mentioned study.

Usage:

Download The ONE simulator or clone from Github via the link --> https://github.com/robgjansen/tps-one-simulator
Clone also this repository and simply copy-paste the Java classes in the corresponding folder.
Compiling and running information are available on the link above.
